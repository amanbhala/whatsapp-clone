Powered By - Node.js

Server - Express.js 

MongoDb - Database.MongoDb is not a real time database so used pusher to make it real time database.

npx create-react-app whatsapp-mern  --> create-react-app is a tool created by facebook, which will create a starter app.

Frontend (app) will be deployed on firebase and backend on hiroku.

npm install @material-ui/core --> To pull in all the material-ui core.

npm install @material-ui/icons

npm start to start the react.js and we do that inside whatsapp-mern.

nodemon server.js to start the node server.js in the whatsapp-backend folder.

In whatsapp-backend folder:

first ran git init command to make it a git repository

then ran npm init command

after that ran server.js command

Ran command npm i express mongoose in whatsapp-backend directory so that everything gets installed.

We are using type:"module" in package.json so that we can write easy to use import statements just like when we were using react.js
